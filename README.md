An inner solar system mock up designed to calculate preliminary delta v required to transfer between two bodies. 
Orbital determination from two state vectors and transit time is known as Lambert's problem.
Transfers are implemented using a universal Lambert solver. 

Controls :
F -> unpause time
R -> Pause time
1, 2, 3, 4 -> choose transfer destination planet

Movement:
Q, E -> rotate camera axis
mouse -> look around
W, A, S, D -> move
